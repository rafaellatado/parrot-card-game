## Project Description

The Parrot Card Game is a memory game where players match pairs of cards featuring parrot GIFs. Upon accessing the app, a prompt asks the user to choose an even number between 4 and 14. 
If the condition is not met, the prompt repeats through a while loop until a valid number is chosen.

A timer tracks the duration of the game, and once the user successfully matches all card pairs, an alert displays the total time and the number of moves taken to win. 
After dismissing the alert, the app automatically restarts by refreshing the page.
